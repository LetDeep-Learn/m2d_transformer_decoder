# 🧾 Project Plan: Modi-to-Devanagari OCR with Self-Supervised Pretraining

## 🎯 Goal:

Build a high-accuracy OCR model that converts **Modi script images** (clean or noisy) into **Devanagari text**, leveraging self-supervised pretraining for improved performance on limited data.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview:

* **2000 Synthetic (clean) Modi images**

  * Font-generated
  * High quality and noise-free

* **2000 Real (noisy) Modi images**

  * Scanned historical documents
  * Blurry, faded, stained, low-quality

---

## 🪜 3-Stage Strategy:

---

### 🧩 **PHASE 1: Self-Supervised Pretraining (No Labels Required)**

#### 🔁 1A. **Denoising Autoencoder (DAE)**

* **Input:** Noisy real image
* **Target:** Corresponding clean synthetic image
* **Goal:** Teach encoder to extract robust, clean visual features from degraded Modi images.

#### 🧠 1B. **Masked Autoencoding (Optional Add-On)**

* **Input:** Modi image with random patches masked
* **Target:** Original full image
* **Goal:** Learn contextual and structural understanding of Modi characters.

> Output of Phase 1: A **pretrained image encoder** that "understands" Modi script visually.

---

### 🔡 **PHASE 2: Supervised Fine-Tuning (Paired Modi Image → Devanagari Text)**

* **Model:**
  `(Pretrained CNN + Transformer Encoder) + Transformer Decoder`

* **Input:** Modi image

* **Target:** Devanagari text label (paired data only)

* **Training:** Teacher forcing + CrossEntropy loss

* **Goal:** Fine-tune the full OCR model for accurate script conversion.

---

### 🔁 **PHASE 3 (Optional): Self-Training / Semi-Supervised Learning**

* **Input:** Unlabeled real Modi images
* **Step 1:** Use trained model to predict Devanagari labels
* **Step 2:** Select high-confidence predictions
* **Step 3:** Add pseudo-labeled data back into training set
* **Goal:** Further improve accuracy with semi-supervised bootstrapping.

Let me know when you're ready to start coding Phase 1 (`modi_ssl_dae.py`) — and we’ll craft it step by step! 🛠️🧙‍♂️









==============================================================
Got it, Omkar — old script tossed into the digital bonfire 🔥. We’re starting fresh, but keeping the **core plan phases** etched in memory like ancient stone tablets:

## 🧠 Modi-to-Devanagari OCR — Phase Summary

### 🧩 Phase 1: Self-Supervised Pretraining
- Denoising Autoencoder (DAE)
- Optional: Masked Autoencoder
- Output: Pretrained image encoder

### 🔡 Phase 2: Supervised Fine-Tuning
- CNN + Transformer Encoder → Transformer Decoder
- Input: Modi image
- Target: Devanagari text
- Output: Full OCR model

### 🔁 Phase 3: Semi-Supervised Self-Training
- Use model to pseudo-label unlabeled data
- Add high-confidence predictions to training set
- Output: Improved generalization

---

From here on, we’ll build everything modularly and cleanly — multiple files, reusable components, and scalable design. Just say the word when you’re ready to start coding Phase 1 again, and I’ll help you scaffold it out in your new structure. Or if you want to sketch the folder layout and file breakdown first, we can do that too.
